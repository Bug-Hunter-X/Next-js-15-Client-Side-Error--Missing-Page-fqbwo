# Next.js 15 Client-Side Error: Missing Page

This repository demonstrates a common client-side error in Next.js 15 applications. The error occurs when navigating to a route that doesn't have a corresponding page file.

## Problem

The application includes a link to an `/about` page. However, if the `/about` page is not correctly configured (e.g., missing the `pages/about.js` file or improper export), a client-side error occurs.

## Solution

Ensure that for every route you link to, there is a corresponding `.js` file or other supported file in your `pages` directory. Make sure that page files correctly use the `export default` syntax.
